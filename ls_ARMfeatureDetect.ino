 Feature test macros ^
 Introduction ^
The feature test macros allow programmers to determine the availability of ACLE or subsets of it, or of target architectural features. This may indicate the availability of some source language extensions (for example intrinsics) or the likely level of performance of some standard C features, such as integer division and floating-point.

Several macros are defined as numeric values to indicate the level of support for particular features. These macros are undefined if the feature is not present. (Aside: in Standard C/C++, references to undefined macros expand to 0 in preprocessor expressions, so a comparison such as:

  #if __ARM_ARCH >= 7
will have the expected effect of evaluating to false if the macro is not defined.)

All ACLE macros begin with the prefix __ARM_. All ACLE macros expand to integral constant expressions suitable for use in an #if directive, unless otherwise specified. Syntactically, they must be primary-expressions generally this means an implementation should enclose them in parentheses if they are not simple constants.

 Testing for Arm C Language Extensions ^
__ARM_ACLE is defined as the version of this specification that is implemented, formatted as {YEAR}{QUARTER}{PATCH}. The YEAR segment is composed of 4 digits, the QUARTER segment is composed of 1 digit, and the PATCH segment is also composed of 1 digit.

For example:

An implementation based on the version 2023 Q2 of the ACLE with no further patch releases will define __ARM_ACLE as 202320.
An implementation based on a hypothetical version 2024 Q3 of the ACLE with two patch releases will define __ARM_ACLE as 202432.
NOTE: Previously, the macro followed the previous versioning scheme and was defined as 100 * major_version + minor_version, which was the version of this specification implemented. For instance, an implementation implementing version 2.1 of the ACLE specification defined __ARM_ACLE as 201.

__ARM_ACLE_VERSION(year, quarter, patch) is defined to express a given ACLE version. Returns with the version number in the same format as the __ARM_ACLE does. Checking the minimum required ACLE version could be written as:

#if __ARM_ACLE >= __ARM_ACLE_VERSION(2024, 1, 0)
 Endianness ^
__ARM_BIG_ENDIAN is defined as 1 if data is stored by default in big-endian format. If the macro is not set, data is stored in little-endian format. (Aside: the “mixed-endian” format for double-precision numbers, used on some very old Arm FPU implementations, is not supported by ACLE or the Arm ABI.)

 Instruction set architecture and features ^
References to the target architecture refer to the target as configured in the tools, for example by appropriate command-line options. This may be a subset or intersection of actual targets, in order to produce a binary that runs on more than one real architecture. For example, use of specific features may be disabled.

In the 32-bit architecture, some hardware features may be accessible from only one or other of A32 or T32 state. For example, in the v5TE and v6 architectures, DSP instructions and (where available) VFP instructions, are only accessible in A32 state, while in the v7-R architecture, hardware divide is only accessible from T32 state. Where both states are available, the implementation should set feature test macros indicating that the hardware feature is accessible. To provide access to the hardware feature, an implementation might override the programmer’s preference for target instruction set, or generate an interworking call to a helper function. This mechanism is outside the scope of ACLE. In cases where the implementation is given a hard requirement to use only one state (for example to support validation, or post-processing) then it should set feature test macros only for the hardware features available in that state as if compiling for a core where the other instruction set was not present.

An implementation that allows a user to indicate which functions go into which state (either as a hard requirement or a preference) is not required to change the settings of architectural feature test macros.

 Arm architecture level ^
__ARM_ARCH is defined as an integer value indicating the current Arm instruction set architecture (for example 7 for the Arm v7-A architecture implemented by Cortex-A8 or the Armv7-M architecture implemented by Cortex-M3 or 8 for the Armv8-A architecture implemented by Cortex-A57). Armv8.1-A [ARMARMv81] onwards, the value of __ARM_ARCH is scaled up to include minor versions. The formula to calculate the value of __ARM_ARCH from Armv8.1-A [ARMARMv81] onwards is given by the following formula:

For an Arm architecture ArmvX.Y, __ARM_ARCH = X * 100 + Y. For example, for Armv8.1 __ARM_ARCH = 801.

Since ACLE only supports the Arm architecture, this macro would always be defined in an ACLE implementation.

Note that the __ARM_ARCH macro is defined even for cores which only support the T32 instruction set.

 Instruction set architecture (A32/T32/A64) ^
__ARM_ARCH_ISA_ARM is defined to 1 if the core supports the Arm instruction set. It is not defined for M-profile cores.

__ARM_ARCH_ISA_THUMB is defined to 1 if the core supports the original T32 instruction set (including the v6-M architecture) and 2 if it supports the T32 instruction set as found in the v6T2 architecture and all v7 architectures.

__ARM_ARCH_ISA_A64 is defined to 1 if the core supports AArch64’s A64 instruction set.

__ARM_32BIT_STATE is defined to 1 if code is being generated for AArch32.

__ARM_64BIT_STATE is defined to 1 if code is being generated for AArch64.

 Architectural profile (A, R, M or pre-Cortex) ^
__ARM_ARCH_PROFILE is defined to be one of the char literals 'A', 'R', 'M' or 'S', or unset, according to the architectural profile of the target. 'S' indicates the common subset of the A and R profiles. The common subset of the A, R and M profiles is indicated by

  __ARM_ARCH == 7 && !defined (__ARM_ARCH_PROFILE)
This macro corresponds to the Tag_CPU_arch_profile object build attribute. It may be useful to writers of system code. It is expected in most cases programmers will use more feature-specific tests.

The macro is undefined for architectural targets which predate the use of architectural profiles.

 Unaligned access supported in hardware ^
__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED is defined if the target supports unaligned access in hardware, at least to the extent of being able to load or store an integer word at any alignment with a single instruction. (There may be restrictions on load-multiple and floating-point accesses.) Note that whether a code generation target permits unaligned access will in general depend on the settings of system register bits, so an implementation should define this macro to match the user’s expectations and intentions. For example, a command-line option might be provided to disable the use of unaligned access, in which case this macro would not be defined.

 LDREX/STREX ^
This feature was deprecated in ACLE 2.0. It is strongly recommended that C11/C++11 atomics be used instead. (See also Synchronization, barrier, and hint intrinsics.)

__ARM_FEATURE_LDREX is defined if the load/store-exclusive instructions (LDREX/STREX) are supported. Its value is a set of bits indicating available widths of the access, as powers of 2. The following bits are used:

Bit	Value	Access width	Instruction
0	0x01	byte	LDREXB/STREXB
1	0x02	halfword	LDREXH/STREXH
2	0x04	word	LDREX/STREX
3	0x08	doubleword	LDREXD/STREXD
Other bits are reserved.

The following values of __ARM_FEATURE_LDREX may occur:

Macro value	Access widths	Example architecture
(undefined)	none	Armv5, Armv6-M
0x04	word	Armv6
0x07	word, halfword, byte	Armv7-M
0x0F	doubleword, word, halfword, byte	Armv6K, Armv7-A/R
Other values are reserved.

The LDREX/STREX instructions are introduced in recent versions of the Arm architecture and supersede the SWP instruction. Where both are available, Arm strongly recommends programmers to use LDREX/STREX rather than SWP. Note that platforms may choose to make SWP unavailable in user mode and emulate it through a trap to a platform routine, or fault it.

 CLZ ^
__ARM_FEATURE_CLZ is defined to 1 if the CLZ (count leading zeroes) instruction is supported in hardware. Note that ACLE provides the __clz() family of intrinsics (see Miscellaneous data-processing intrinsics) even when __ARM_FEATURE_CLZ is not defined.

 Q (saturation) flag ^
__ARM_FEATURE_QBIT is defined to 1 if the Q (saturation) global flag exists and the intrinsics defined in The Q (saturation) flag are available. This flag is used with the DSP saturating-arithmetic instructions (such as QADD) and the width-specified saturating instructions (SSAT and USAT). Note that either of these classes of instructions may exist without the other: for example, v5E has only QADD while v7-M has only SSAT.

Intrinsics associated with the Q-bit and their feature macro __ARM_FEATURE_QBIT are deprecated in ACLE 2.0 for A-profile. They are fully supported for M-profile and R-profile. This macro is defined for AArch32 only.

 DSP instructions ^
__ARM_FEATURE_DSP is defined to 1 if the DSP (v5E) instructions are supported and the intrinsics defined in Saturating intrinsics are available. These instructions include QADD, SMULBB and others. This feature also implies support for the Q flag.

__ARM_FEATURE_DSP and its associated intrinsics are deprecated in ACLE 2.0 for A-profile. They are fully supported for M and R-profiles. This macro is defined for AArch32 only.

 Saturation instructions ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SAT is defined to 1 if the SSAT and USAT instructions are supported and the intrinsics defined in Width-specified saturation intrinsics are available. This feature also implies support for the Q flag.

__ARM_FEATURE_SAT and its associated intrinsics are deprecated in ACLE 2.0 for A-profile. They are fully supported for M and R-profiles. This macro is defined for AArch32 only.


 32-bit SIMD instructions ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32 is defined to 1 if the 32-bit SIMD instructions are supported and the intrinsics defined in 32-bit SIMD Operations are available. This also implies support for the GE global flags which indicate byte-by-byte comparison results.

__ARM_FEATURE_SIMD32 is deprecated in ACLE 2.0 for A-profile. Users are encouraged to use Neon Intrinsics as an equivalent for the 32-bit SIMD intrinsics functionality. However they are fully supported for M and R-profiles. This is defined for AArch32 only.

 Hardware integer divide ^
__ARM_FEATURE_IDIV is defined to 1 if the target has hardware support for 32-bit integer division in all available instruction sets. Signed and unsigned versions are both assumed to be available. The intention is to allow programmers to choose alternative algorithm implementations depending on the likely speed of integer division.

Some older R-profile targets have hardware divide available in the T32 instruction set only. This can be tested for using the following test:

    #if __ARM_FEATURE_IDIV || (__ARM_ARCH_PROFILE == 'R')
 CRC32 extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_CRC32 is defined to 1 if the CRC32 instructions are supported and the intrinsics defined in CRC32 intrinsics are available. These instructions include CRC32B, CRC32H and others. This is only available when __ARM_ARCH >= 8.

 Random Number Generation Extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_RNG is defined to 1 if the Random Number Generation instructions are supported and the intrinsics defined in Random number generation intrinsics are available.

 Branch Target Identification ^
__ARM_FEATURE_BTI_DEFAULT is defined to 1 if the Branch Target Identification extension is used to protect branch destinations by default. The protection applied to any particular function may be overridden by mechanisms such as function attributes.

__ARM_FEATURE_BTI is defined to 1 if Branch Target Identification extension is available on the target. It is undefined otherwise.

 Pointer Authentication ^
__ARM_FEATURE_PAC_DEFAULT is defined as a bitmap to indicate the use of the Pointer Authentication extension to protect code against code reuse attacks by default. The bits are defined as follows:

Bit	Meaning
0	Protection using the A key
1	Protection using the B key
2	Protection including leaf functions
3	Protection using PC as a diversifier
For example, a value of 0x5 indicates that the Pointer Authentication extension is used to protect function entry points, including leaf functions, using the A key for signing. The protection applied to any particular function may be overridden by mechanisms such as function attributes.

__ARM_FEATURE_PAUTH is defined to 1 if Pointer Authentication extension (FEAT_PAuth) is available on the target. It is undefined otherwise.

__ARM_FEATURE_PAUTH_LR is defined to 1 if Armv9.5-A enhancements to the Pointer Authentication extension (FEAT_PAuth_LR) are available on the target. It is undefined otherwise.

 Guarded Control Stack ^
__ARM_FEATURE_GCS_DEFAULT is defined to 1 if the code generation is compatible with enabling the Guarded Control Stack (GCS) extension based protection. It is undefined otherwise.

__ARM_FEATURE_GCS is defined to 1 if the Guarded Control Stack (GCS) extension is available on the target. It is undefined otherwise.

 Large System Extensions ^
__ARM_FEATURE_ATOMICS is defined if the Large System Extensions introduced in the Armv8.1-A [ARMARMv81] architecture are supported on this target. Note: It is strongly recommended that standardized C11/C++11 atomics are used to implement atomic operations in user code.

 Transactional Memory Extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_TME is defined to 1 if the Transactional Memory Extension instructions are supported in hardware and intrinsics defined in Transactional Memory Extension (TME) intrinsics are available.

 Armv8.7-A Load/Store 64 Byte extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_LS64 is defined to 1 if the Armv8.7-A LD64B, ST64B, ST64BV and ST64BV0 instructions for atomic 64-byte access to device memory are supported. This macro may only ever be defined in the AArch64 execution state. Intrinsics for using these instructions are specified in Load/store 64 Byte intrinsics.

 memcpy family of memory operations standarization instructions - MOPS ^
If the CPYF*, CPY*, SET* and SETG* instructions are supported, __ARM_FEATURE_MOPS is defined to 1. These instructions were introduced in the Armv8.8-A and Armv9.3-A architecture updates for standardization of memcpy, memset, and memmove family of memory operations (MOPS).

The __ARM_FEATURE_MOPS macro can only be implemented in the AArch64 execution state. Intrinsics for the use of these instructions are specified in memcpy family of operations intrinsics - MOPS

 RCPC ^
__ARM_FEATURE_RCPC is set if the weaker RCpc (Release Consistent processor consistent) model is supported. It is undefined otherwise. The value indicates the set of Load-Acquire and Store-Release instructions available. The intention is to allow programmers to guard the usage of these instructions in inline assembly.

If defined, the value of __ARM_FEATURE_RCPC remains consistent with the decimal value of LRCPC field (bits [23:20]) in the ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1 register. For convenience these are shown below:

Value	Feature	Instructions	Availability
1	FEAT_LRCPC	LDAPR* instructions	Armv8.3, optional Armv8.2
2	FEAT_LRCPC2	LDAPUR* and STLUR* instructions	Armv8.4, optional Armv8.2
3	FEAT_LRCPC3	See FEAT_LRCPC3 documentation	Armv8.9, optional Armv8.2
The __ARM_FEATURE_RCPC macro can only be implemented in the AArch64 execution state.

 128-bit system registers ^
If the MRRS and MSRR instructions are supported, __ARM_FEATURE_SYSREG128 is defined to 1. These instructions were introduced in the Armv9.4-A architecture updates to support 128-bit system register accesses.

The __ARM_FEATURE_SYSREG128 macro can only be implemented in the AArch64 execution state. Intrinsics for the use of these instructions are specified in Special register intrinsics.

 Floating-point and vector hardware ^
 Hardware floating point ^
__ARM_FP is set if hardware floating-point is available. The value is a set of bits indicating the floating-point precisions supported. The following bits are used:

Bit	Value	Precision
1	0x02	half (16-bit) data type only
2	0x04	single (32-bit)
3	0x08	double (64-bit)
Bits 0 and 4..31 are reserved

Currently, the following values of __ARM_FP may occur (assuming the processor configuration option for hardware floating-point support is selected where available):

Value	Precisions	Example processor
(undefined)	none	any processor without hardware floating-point support
0x04	single	Cortex-R5 when configured with SP only
0x06	single, half	Cortex-M4.fp
0x0C	double, single	Arm9, Arm11, Cortex-A8, Cortex-R4
0x0E	double, single, half	Cortex-A9, Cortex-A15, Cortex-R7
Other values are reserved.

Standard C implementations support single and double precision floating-point irrespective of whether floating-point hardware is available. However, an implementation might choose to offer a mode to diagnose or fault use of floating-point arithmetic at a precision not supported in hardware.

Support for 16-bit floating-point language or 16-bit brain floating-point language extensions (see Half-precision (16-bit) floating-point format and Brain 16-bit floating-point support) is only required if supported in hardware.

 Half-precision (16-bit) floating-point format ^
__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_IEEE is defined to 1 if the IEEE 754-2008 [IEEE-FP] 16-bit floating-point format is used.

__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE is defined to 1 if the Arm alternative [ARMARM] 16-bit floating-point format is used. This format removes support for infinities and NaNs in order to provide an additional binade.

At most one of these macros will be defined. See Half-precision floating-point for details of half-precision floating-point types.

 Half-precision argument and result ^
__ARM_FP16_ARGS is defined to 1 if __fp16 can be used as an argument and result.

 Vector extensions ^
 Advanced SIMD architecture extension (Neon) ^
__ARM_NEON is defined to a value indicating the Advanced SIMD (Neon) architecture supported. The only current value is 1.

In principle, for AArch32, the Neon architecture can exist in an integer-only version. To test for the presence of Neon floating-point vector instructions, test __ARM_NEON_FP. When Neon does occur in an integer-only version, the VFP scalar instruction set is also not present. See [ARMARM] (table A2-4) for architecturally permitted combinations.

__ARM_NEON is always set to 1 for AArch64.

 Neon floating-point ^
__ARM_NEON_FP is defined as a bitmap to indicate floating-point support in the Neon architecture. The meaning of the values is the same as for __ARM_FP. This macro is undefined when the Neon extension is not present or does not support floating-point.

Current AArch32 Neon implementations do not support double-precision floating-point even when it is present in VFP. 16-bit floating-point format is supported in Neon if and only if it is supported in VFP. Consequently, the definition of __ARM_NEON_FP is the same as __ARM_FP except that the bit to indicate double-precision is not set for AArch32. Double-precision is always set for AArch64.

If __ARM_FEATURE_FMA and __ARM_NEON_FP are both defined, fused-multiply instructions are available in Neon also.

 Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SVE is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the FEAT_SVE instructions and if the associated ACLE features are available. This implies that __ARM_NEON and __ARM_NEON_FP are both nonzero.

The following macros indicate the presence of various optional SVE language extensions:

__ARM_FEATURE_SVE_BITS==N

When N is nonzero, this indicates that the implementation is generating code for an N-bit SVE target and that the implementation supports the arm_sve_vector_bits(N) attribute. N may also be zero, but this carries the same meaning as not defining the macro. See The __ARM_FEATURE_SVE_BITS macro for details.

__ARM_FEATURE_SVE_VECTOR_OPERATORS==N

N >= 1 indicates that applying the arm_sve_vector_bits attribute to an SVE vector type creates a type that supports the GNU vector extensions. This condition is only meaningful when __ARM_FEATURE_SVE_BITS is nonzero. See arm_sve_vector_bits behavior specific to vectors for details.

N >= 2 indicates that the operators outlined in the GNU vector extensions additionally work on sizeless SVE vector types like svint32_t. The availability of operators on sizeless types is independent of __ARM_FEATURE_SVE_BITS.

__ARM_FEATURE_SVE_PREDICATE_OPERATORS==N

N >= 1 indicates that applying the arm_sve_vector_bits attribute to svbool_t creates a type that supports basic built-in vector operations. The state of this macro is only meaningful when __ARM_FEATURE_SVE_BITS is nonzero. See arm_sve_vector_bits behavior specific to predicates for details.

N >= 2 indicates that the built-in vector operations described above additionally work on svbool_t. The availability of operators on svbool_t is independent of __ARM_FEATURE_SVE_BITS.

 SVE2 ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SVE2 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the Armv9-A SVE2 extension (FEAT_SVE2) and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_SVE is nonzero.

__ARM_FEATURE_SVE2p1 is defined to 1 if the FEAT_SVE2p1 instructions are available and if the associated [ACLE features] (#sme-language-extensions-and-intrinsics) are supported.

 NEON-SVE Bridge macro ^
__ARM_NEON_SVE_BRIDGE is defined to 1 if the <arm_neon_sve_bridge.h> header file is available.

 Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) ^
The specification for SME2.1 is in Beta state and the specification for the rest of SME is in Beta state. The specifications may change or be extended in the future.

ACLE provides features for accessing the Scalable Matrix Extension (SME). Each revision of SME has an associated preprocessor macro, given in the table below:

Feature	Macro
FEAT_SME	__ARM_FEATURE_SME
FEAT_SME2	__ARM_FEATURE_SME2
FEAT_SME2p1	__ARM_FEATURE_SME2p1
Each macro is defined if there is hardware support for the associated architecture feature and if all of the ACLE features that are conditional on the macro are supported.

In addition, __ARM_FEATURE_LOCALLY_STREAMING is defined to 1 if the arm_locally_streaming attribute is available.

 M-profile Vector Extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_MVE is defined as a bitmap to indicate M-profile Vector Extension (MVE) support.

Bit	Value	Support
0	0x01	Integer MVE
1	0x02	Floating-point MVE
 Wireless MMX ^
If Wireless MMX operations are available on the target, __ARM_WMMX is defined to a value that indicates the level of support, corresponding to the Tag_WMMX_arch build attribute.

This specification does not further define source-language features to support Wireless MMX.

 16-bit floating-point extensions ^

 16-bit floating-point data processing operations ^
__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC is defined to 1 if the 16-bit floating-point arithmetic instructions are supported in hardware and the associated scalar intrinsics defined by ACLE are available. Note that this implies:

__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_IEEE == 1
__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE == 0
__ARM_FP & 0x02 == 1
__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC is defined to 1 if the 16-bit floating-point arithmetic instructions are supported in hardware and the associated vector intrinsics defined by ACLE are available. Note that this implies:

__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_IEEE == 1
__ARM_FP16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE == 0
__ARM_FP & 0x02 == 1
__ARM_NEON_FP & 0x02 == 1
 FP16 FML extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_FP16_FML is defined to 1 if the FP16 multiplication variant instructions from Armv8.2-A are supported and intrinsics targeting them are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_FP16_SCALAR_ARITHMETIC is defined to a nonzero value.

 Half-precision floating-point SME intrinsics ^
The specification for SME2.1 is in Beta state and might change or be extended in the future.

__ARM_FEATURE_SME_F16F16 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SME2 half-precision (FEAT_SME_F16F16) instructions and if their associated intrinsics are available.

 Brain 16-bit floating-point support ^
__ARM_BF16_FORMAT_ALTERNATIVE is defined to 1 if the Arm alternative [ARMARM] 16-bit brain floating-point format is used. This format closely resembles the IEEE 754 single-precision format. As such a brain half-precision floating point value can be converted to an IEEE 754 single-floating point format by appending 16 zero bits at the end.

__ARM_FEATURE_BF16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the Advanced SIMD brain 16-bit floating-point arithmetic instructions and if the associated ACLE vector intrinsics are available. This implies:

__ARM_FP & 0x02 == 1
__ARM_NEON_FP & 0x02 == 1
Similarly, __ARM_FEATURE_SVE_BF16 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SVE BF16 extensions and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_BF16_VECTOR_ARITHMETIC and __ARM_FEATURE_SVE are both nonzero.

See Half-precision brain floating-point for details of half-precision brain floating-point types.

 Non-widening brain 16-bit floating-point support ^
The specification for B16B16 is in Alpha state and might change or be extended in the future.

__ARM_FEATURE_SVE_B16B16 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the FEAT_SVE_B16B16 instructions and if their associated intrinsics are available. Specifically, if this macro is defined to 1, then:

the SVE subset of the FEAT_SVE_B16B16 intrinsics are available in non-streaming statements if __ARM_FEATURE_SVE is nonzero.

the SVE subset of the FEAT_SVE_B16B16 intrinsics are available in streaming-compatible statements if __ARM_FEATURE_SME is nonzero.

all FEAT_SVE_B16B16 intrinsics are available in streaming statements if __ARM_FEATURE_SME is nonzero.

__ARM_FEATURE_SME_B16B16 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the FEAT_SME_B16B16 instructions and if their associated intrinsics are available.

 Cryptographic extensions ^
 “Crypto” extension ^
NOTE: The __ARM_FEATURE_CRYPTO macro is deprecated in favor of the finer grained feature macros described below.

__ARM_FEATURE_CRYPTO is defined to 1 if the Armv8-A Crypto instructions are supported and intrinsics targeting them are available. These instructions include AES{E, D}, SHA1{C, P, M} and others. This also implies __ARM_FEATURE_AES and __ARM_FEATURE_SHA2.

 AES extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_AES is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the Advanced SIMD AES Crypto instructions from Armv8-A and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. These instructions are identified by FEAT_AES and FEAT_PMULL in [ARMARMv8], and they include AES{E, D}, AESMC, AESIMC and others.

In addition, __ARM_FEATURE_SVE2_AES is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SVE2 AES (FEAT_SVE_AES) instructions and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_AES and __ARM_FEATURE_SVE2 are both nonzero.

 SHA2 extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SHA2 is defined to 1 if the SHA1 & SHA2-256 Crypto instructions from Armv8-A are supported and intrinsics targeting them are available. These instructions are identified by FEAT_SHA1 and FEAT_SHA256 in [ARMARMv8], and they include SHA1{C, P, M}, SHA256H, SHA256H2… and others.

 SHA512 extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SHA512 is defined to 1 if the SHA2-512 Crypto instructions from Armv8.2-A are supported and intrinsics targeting them are available. These instructions are identified by FEAT_SHA512 in [ARMARMv82], and they include SHA1{C, P, M}, SHA256H, SHA256H2, …, SHA512H, SHA512H2, SHA512SU0… and others. Note: FEAT_SHA512 requires both FEAT_SHA1 and FEAT_SHA256.

 SHA3 extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SHA3 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the Advanced SIMD SHA1 & SHA2 Crypto instructions from Armv8-A and the SHA2 and SHA3 instructions from Armv8.2-A and newer and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. These instructions include AES{E, D}, SHA1{C, P, M}, RAX, and others.

In addition, __ARM_FEATURE_SVE2_SHA3 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SVE2 SHA3 (FEAT_SVE_SHA3) instructions and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_SHA3 and __ARM_FEATURE_SVE2 are both nonzero.

 SM3 extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SM3 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for Advanced SIMD SM3 Crypto instructions from Armv8.2-A and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. These instructions include SM3{TT1A, TT1B}, and others.

In addition, __ARM_FEATURE_SVE2_SM3 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SVE2 SM3 (FEAT_SVE_SM3) instructions and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_SM3 and __ARM_FEATURE_SVE2 are both nonzero.

 SM4 extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SM4 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the Advanced SIMD SM4 Crypto instructions from Armv8.2-A and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. These instructions include SM4{E, EKEY} and others.

In addition, __ARM_FEATURE_SVE2_SM4 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SVE2 SM4 (FEAT_SVE_SM4) instructions and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_SM4 and __ARM_FEATURE_SVE2 are both nonzero.

 Fused multiply-accumulate (FMA) ^
__ARM_FEATURE_FMA is defined to 1 if the hardware floating-point architecture supports fused floating-point multiply-accumulate, that is, without intermediate rounding. Note that C implementations are encouraged [C99] (7.12) to ensure that defines `FP_FAST_FMAF` or `FP_FAST_FMA`, which can be tested by portable C code. A C implementation on Arm might define these macros by testing `__ARM_FEATURE_FMA` and `__ARM_FP`.

This macro implies support for floating-point instructions but it does not in itself imply support for vector instructions. See Neon floating-point for the conditions under which vector fused multiply-accumulate operations are available.

This macro may only ever be defined in the AArch64 execution state. The scalar intrinsics are specified in Floating-point data-processing intrinsics and are not expected to be for general use. They are defined for uses that require the specialist rounding behavior of the relevant instructions.

In addition, __ARM_FEATURE_SVE_MATMUL_INT8 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SVE forms of these instructions and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_MATMUL_INT8 and __ARM_FEATURE_SVE are both nonzero.

 Multiplication of 32-bit floating-point matrices ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SVE_MATMUL_FP32 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SVE 32-bit floating-point matrix multiply (FEAT_F32MM) instructions and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_SVE is nonzero.

 Multiplication of 64-bit floating-point matrices ^
__ARM_FEATURE_SVE_MATMUL_FP64 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SVE 64-bit floating-point matrix multiply (FEAT_F64MM) instructions and if the associated ACLE intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_SVE is nonzero.

 Bit permute extension ^

__ARM_FEATURE_SME_I16I64 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SME 16-bit to 64-bit integer widening outer product (FEAT_SME_I16I64) instructions and if their associated intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_SME is nonzero.

 Double precision floating-point outer product intrinsics ^
The specification for SME is in Beta state and might change or be extended in the future.

__ARM_FEATURE_SME_TMOP is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SME structured sparsity outer product (FEAT_SME_TMOP) instructions and if their associated intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_SME2 is nonzero.

__ARM_FEATURE_SME_MOP4 is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for the SME quarter-tile outer product (FEAT_SME_MOP4) instructions and if their associated intrinsics are available. This implies that __ARM_FEATURE_SME2 is nonzero.

 CSSC Extension ^
__ARM_FEATURE_CSSC is defined to 1 if there is hardware support for common short sequence compression instructions. This includes the instructions ABS, CNT, CTZ and SMAX, SMIN, UMAX, UMIN (register/immediate).

 Floating-point model ^
These macros test the floating-point model implemented by the compiler and libraries. The model determines the guarantees on arithmetic and exceptions.

__ARM_FP_FAST is defined to 1 if floating-point optimizations may occur such that the computed results are different from those prescribed by the order of operations according to the C standard. Examples of such optimizations would be reassociation of expressions to reduce depth, and replacement of a division by constant with multiplication by its reciprocal.

__ARM_FP_FENV_ROUNDING is defined to 1 if the implementation allows the rounding to be configured at runtime using the standard C fesetround() function and will apply this rounding to future floating-point operations. The rounding mode applies to both scalar floating-point and Neon.

The floating-point implementation might or might not support denormal values. If denormal values are not supported then they are flushed to zero.

Implementations may also define the following macros in appropriate floating-point modes:

__STDC_IEC_559__ is defined if the implementation conforms to IEC This implies support for floating-point exception status flags, including the inexact exception. This macro is specified by [C99] (6.10.8).

__SUPPORT_SNAN__ is defined if the implementation supports signalling NaNs. This macro is specified by the C standards proposal WG14 N965 Optional support for Signaling NaNs. (Note: this was not adopted into C11.)

 Procedure call standard ^
__ARM_PCS is defined to 1 if the default procedure calling standard for the translation unit conforms to the base PCS defined in [AAPCS]. This is supported on AArch32 only.

__ARM_PCS_VFP is defined to 1 if the default is to pass floating-point parameters in hardware floating-point registers using the VFP variant PCS defined in [AAPCS]. This is supported on AArch32 only.

__ARM_PCS_AAPCS64 is defined to 1 if the default procedure calling standard for the translation unit conforms to the [AAPCS64].

Note that this should reflect the implementation default for the translation unit. Implementations which allow the PCS to be set for a function, class or namespace are not expected to redefine the macro within that scope.

 Position-independent code ^
__ARM_ROPI is defined to 1 if the translation unit is being compiled in read-only position independent mode. In this mode, all read-only data and functions are at a link-time constant offset from the program counter.

__ARM_RWPI is defined to 1 if the translation unit is being compiled in read-write position independent mode. In this mode, all writable data is at a link-time constant offset from the static base register defined in [AAPCS].

The ROPI and RWPI position independence modes are compatible with each other, so the __ARM_ROPI and __ARM_RWPI macros may be defined at the same time.

 Coprocessor intrinsics ^
__ARM_FEATURE_COPROC is defined as a bitmap to indicate the presence of coprocessor intrinsics for the target architecture. If __ARM_FEATURE_COPROC is undefined or zero, that means there is no support for coprocessor intrinsics on the target architecture. The following bits are used:

/*
On the STM32, some magic is worked internally so that each bit in a pre-defined memory range can be addressed as another location in a kind of virtual address space somewhere else. So, for example, the 32 bit value stored at address 0x20000000 also appears as 32 sequential memory locations starting at 0x22000000. There are two regions of memory that have bit-band alias regions. First there is a 1Mbyte SRAM region from 0x20000000 – 0x20100000 where each bit is aliases by a byte address in the range 0x22000000 – 0x23FFFFFF. Then there is the peripheral space from 0x40000000 – 0x40100000 which is aliased in the same way to the range 0x42000000 – 0x43FFFFFF.

Using this scheme, a read or write to memory location 0x22000000 is the same as a read or write to the least significant bit of SRAM location 0x20000000. I have no intention of going through the whole thing.

If you want to find out more about this and many other dark STM32 secrets, read the excellent book by Joseph Yiu – The Definitive Guide to the Arm Cortex – M3

The Peripheral Library, among other sources, provides us C programmers with macros to do the address translation. They look like this for the SRAM memory space:


#define RAM_BASE 0x20000000
#define RAM_BB_BASE 0x22000000
#define Var_ResetBit_BB(VarAddr, BitNumber)
(*(vu32 *) (RAM_BB_BASE | ((VarAddr - RAM_BASE) << 5) | ((BitNumber) << 2)) = 0)
#define Var_SetBit_BB(VarAddr, BitNumber)
(*(vu32 *) (RAM_BB_BASE | ((VarAddr - RAM_BASE) << 5) | ((BitNumber) << 2)) = 1)
#define Var_GetBit_BB(VarAddr, BitNumber)
(*(vu32 *) (RAM_BB_BASE | ((VarAddr - RAM_BASE) << 5) | ((BitNumber) << 2)))

These are all well and good but not too intuitive to use. Even if you understand what they do. Rather than mess with these, I define a couple of additional versions that look like this:


#define varSetBit(var,bit) (Var_SetBit_BB((u32)&var,bit))
#define varGetBit(var,bit) (Var_GetBit_BB((u32)&var,bit))
#define varGetBit(var,bit) (Var_GetBit_BB((u32)&var,bit))

Using these macros is quite simple. The following are all legitimate ways to use them:


uint32_t flags;
uint32_t status;
varSetBit(flags,1);
varSetBit(flags,READY_BIT);
varClrBit(flags,3);
ready = varGetBit(flags,READY_BIT);

It is interesting to note that the varGetBit macro is an LValue so that it can be used in an assignment like this:


varGetBit(flags,4) = y;
varGetBit(flags,ARRIVED) = varGetBit(status,READY);

These methods are not primarily about speed but convenience. The compiler cannot know where the variables will be stored when the code is generated so you will see some of the calculations done at run time by your program. However, if you use the pointer method in the code fragment above, the calculation of the alias address is done only once and you will be able to get to the bit variables quite efficiently after that. To access bits in the peripheral registers, you use the exact same technique but with different base registers. There is, of course, no reason why you could not define a macro that refers to a specific bit in a peripheral register at a known address. Then you get the addresses completely pre-calculated by the compiler and the most efficient code since the peripheral register addresses are known at compile time.
